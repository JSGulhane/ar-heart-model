Description:
This project showcases an Augmented Reality (AR) experience of 3D human organs
— heart, lungs, brain, and kidney — using marker-based AR. By pointing a camera
at a Hiro marker, users can visualize and interact with rotating 3D models of these
organs in real space through a web browser. The interface includes controls to switch
between different organs, pause/resume rotation, and adjust each model’s orientation
for educational or demonstrative purposes.
The project is lightweight and accessible via a simple link without needing an app
download.

Tools & Technologies Used
• HTML/CSS/JavaScript – For structuring and interactivity
• A-Frame – Web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences
• AR.js – Lightweight AR library for A-Frame (marker-based AR)
• GLTF/GLB – 3D model format
• Vercel – Deployment and hosting
• GitHub – Version control

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of Web AR using open-source libraries to
deliver immersive educational content. It requires no app installation, making it
easily accessible to users on any device. The ability to rotate and interact with the
3D model enhances the learning experience.
This implementation can be extended to other biological models or real-world objects
for medical education, e-learning, or museum experiences.
